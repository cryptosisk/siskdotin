                Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Nucels DAO utilizes smart contracts for governance 
                and content management. Our architecture combines on-chain voting mechanisms with 
                off-chain content storage solutions, ensuring both decentralization and scalability.
                The platform incorporates IPFS for content storage and implements a novel token 
                economics model for sustainable creator rewards.

                Our vision is to create a self-sustaining ecosystem where creators can thrive 
                without intermediaries. We believe in a future where content creation and 
                distribution are truly decentralized, transparent, and equitable. Through 
                innovative governance mechanisms and economic incentives, we're building a 
                platform that aligns the interests of creators, curators, and consumers.
